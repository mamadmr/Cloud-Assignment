Set Up Celery with Redis as the Message Broker:
(i) Configure Celery to use Redis as its message broker.
-->
configuration: mycelery.py
exec : celery -A mycelery worker --loglevel=info

(ii) Make sure Celery can connect to Redis and run successfully.
-->
if all right output must be :
[INFO/MainProcess] Connected to redis://localhost:6379/0
[INFO/MainProcess] Ready.



Implement Celery Tasks for Container Management:
(i) Write Celery tasks that:
(a) Start a Docker container for a specific CTF challenge.
(b) Stop a running Docker container using its ID.
-->
configuration: mycelery.py
celery -A mycelery worker --loglevel=info
task a,b : docker_tasks.py

(ii) Make sure these tasks run in the background (asynchronously) and handle any errors gracefully.
-->
celery -A mycelery status





Demonstrate Task Execution and Container Lifecycle Management:
(i) Call the Celery tasks to start and stop Docker containers.
(ii) Observe and confirm that the containers change state as expected before and after running the tasks.
