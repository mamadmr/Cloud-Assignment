##redis
``` docker run -d --name rds -p 6390:6379 redis:7.0```

The explaination is the same as Q1

Int the first client program I set 5 keys to a value and then published hello followed by an integer to a channel then in the second program I retrieved all the keys and values and then listened to the channel for incoming messages.

Using redis insight will be explained in the recorded video.
