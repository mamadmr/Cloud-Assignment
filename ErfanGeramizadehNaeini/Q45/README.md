# web app
I wrote django application with 5 apis 3 of them is for authenticating and registering.(ignore get-ip and token/refresh )
swagger is not implemented instead I explain my apis here
	
instead of explaining APIs I implemented a swagger.

run docker compose up --build and the visit localhost:3000/docs to see the swagger.

## Database schema:
cloud_team is an AbstractUser means that it has everything that a normal user would have.
Like username and password and email.

cloud_problem(name,number,description,image_name,port)
Name and number and description are obvious.
Image_name specifies the name of the image used for this problem.  You can create two problems with the image name mentioned in the homework document.
Port specifies the port in the container that the image uses and should be bound to the outside port on the host.
cloud_teamproblem(	team,problem,up,ip,port,container_id)
This table implements a many to many relationship betwean team and problem.
Team and problem are foreign keys.
Up is a boolean showing the status of the question container.
Ip is useless because I distinguish containers by their ports.
Port shows the port on host to access the container.
Container_id is what the name implies. It is used to stop that container if needed.

## setting up
Setting up the application is rather easy .just look at .env files and configure them as you desire then just write docker compose up â€“build and hit enter.
